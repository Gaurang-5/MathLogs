# ✅ SCAN UI FIXED

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED (v56)**

## 🛠 THE FIX
I have removed the duplicate Red Overlay Box from the "Scan Marks" screen.
Now you should see only **one** scanning frame (the native white viewfinder) instead of two conflicting boxes.

## 🚀 TRY IT NOW
1.  **Refresh your page.**
2.  Go to **Scan Marks**.
3.  Select a test and start the camera.
4.  Verify that the view is clean with a single scanning area.
