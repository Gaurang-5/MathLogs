# ✅ MULTI-TENANT EMAIL SYSTEM UPGRADED

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED (v60)**

---

## 🛠 THE UPGRADE
I have completely redeveloped the email system to support **Multiple Coaching Institutes**.

### How it works now:
1.  **Dynamic Sender Name:** Emails (Invites & Reminders) now appear to come from **"Institute Name"** instead of a generic "Coaching Centre".
2.  **Smart Reply-To:** If a student attempts to reply to the automated email, the reply will go directly to the **Institute's Email Address** (from their Settings Profile), *not* to the System Admin.
3.  **Personalized Signatures:** The email footer now signs off as the specific Institute.

### Affected Features:
-   **WhatsApp Group Invites:** Uses the Institute's name and WhatsApp link.
-   **Fee Reminders:** Uses the Institute's name and payment instructions context.

No action is required from you. As long as users update their **Settings > Profile**, the emails will automatically reflect their institute's identity.
