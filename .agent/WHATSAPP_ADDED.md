# ✅ WHATSAPP CONTACT ADDED

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED (v57)**

---

## 🛠 THE FEATURE
I have implemented **Option C** (The "WhatsApp First" Approach).

1.  **Floating Button:** A green WhatsApp chat bubble in the bottom-right corner.
2.  **Contact Section:** A dedicated "Still have questions?" section at the bottom of the page.
3.  **Direct Link:** Clicking opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled message ("Hi, I have a question about MathLogs").

---

## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED
I used a placeholder phone number (`91 98765 43210`).
**You MUST provide your actual WhatsApp number** so I can update it, or visitors will be chatting with a stranger!

## 🚀 TRY IT NOW
1.  **Refresh your page.**
2.  Scroll to the bottom to see the new section.
3.  Look for the green button in the corner.
