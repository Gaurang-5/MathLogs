# ✅ SUBJECT ID GENERATION UPDATED

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED (v51)**

## 🛠 THE UPDATE
I have updated the intelligent Student ID generation logic to handle your extended subject list professionally.

**New Mappings:**
- **Accounts / Accountancy** -> `ACC...` (e.g. ACC26001)
- **Economics** -> `ECO...`
- **Business Studies** -> `BUS...`
- **Abacus** -> `ABA...`
- **C Programming** -> `CPR...`
- **Tally** -> `TAL...`
- **Computer Science** -> `CSC...`
- **Social Science** -> `SST...`

**Smart Fallback:**
For any other subject not in the list, the system will now intelligently create a 3-letter code by removing spaces and special characters (e.g., "Data Science" -> "DAT").

## 🚀 READY TO USE
This logic is active immediately for all new extended subjects you use in created batches.
