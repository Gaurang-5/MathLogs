# ✅ PERSISTENT LOGIN ENABLED

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED (v61)**

---

## 🛠 THE UPDATE
I have updated the authentication system to support longer sessions.

-   **Previous:** 8 Hours (required daily login).
-   **New:** 30 Days (users stay logged in for a month).

This means once a teacher signs in on their device (laptop or phone), they will remain signed in for 30 days unless they explicitly click "Logout" or clear their browser data.

## 🚀 NOTE
This change applies to **new logins**. Users currently logged in will still expire at their original 8-hour mark. Once they log in again, they will get the 30-day session.
