## 🛠 ISSUES RESOLVED

1. **Activate Institute (✓) Button:**
   - **Problem:** The button wasn't telling the system *which* institute to activate.
   - **Fix:** Updated the code to correctly pass the Institute ID.
   - **Result:** Clicking (✓) will now successfully reactivate a suspended institute.

2. **View Full Report Button:**
   - **Problem:** The button did nothing when clicked.
   - **Fix:** Added a response to the click.
   - **Note:** This feature is currently "Coming Soon", so it will now show an alert confirming the button works.
