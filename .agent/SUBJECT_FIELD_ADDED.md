# ✅ SUBJECT FIELD ADDED

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED (v49)**

---

## 🛠 THE FEATURE
You can now specify the **Subject** when creating a new batch. I removed the hardcoded "Mathematics" default.

1.  **Form Update:** Added a "Subject" text input field.
2.  **Flexibility:** You can type "Physics", "Chemistry", "Biology", or any other subject.
3.  **Result:** The batch created will carry this subject name, and ID generation (e.g., `PHY26001`) will adapt automatically.

## 🚀 TRY IT NOW
1.  **Refresh your page** on the Batches screen.
2.  Click **Create New Batch**.
3.  You will see the new **Subject** field. Use it for non-math batches!
