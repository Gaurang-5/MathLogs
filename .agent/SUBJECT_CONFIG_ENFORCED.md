# ✅ SUBJECT CONFIGURATION ENFORCED

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED (v50)**

---

## 🛠 THE FEATURE
The "Subject" field in the Create Batch form now strictly adheres to your Institute's Configuration.

1.  **Config-Driven:** The app fetches your institute's settings.
2.  **Smart UI:** 
    -   If you have defined subjects in your config (e.g., `["Physics", "Chemistry"]`), it shows a **Dropdown** with only those options.
    -   If no config is found, it falls back to a Text Input (so you are never blocked).

## 🚀 TRY IT NOW
1.  **Refresh your page.**
2.  Click **Create New Batch**.
3.  You should now see a Dropdown (if your institute is configured) or a Text Input.
